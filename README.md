# 200 Days of MERN & JAVA FULL Stack Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **200-day journey** of mastering full-stack web development with the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and the **JAVA FULL STACK Stack** (Java, Angular, MongoDB, Spring Boot). This repository will document my progress, projects, and code samples as I work towards becoming proficient in both stacks.

## 🎯 **Challenge Goals**

1. **MERN Stack Mastery**:
   - Build robust, real-world applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
   - Focus on backend development, frontend interactions, and deployment strategies.
   - Learn to integrate third-party APIs and handle state management in React.

2. **Java Full Stack Mastery**:
   - Develop enterprise-grade applications using Java, Angular, MongoDB, and Spring Boot.
   - Build scalable backend systems with Spring Boot and highly interactive frontends with Angular.
   - Implement REST APIs, authentication, and best practices in full-stack Java development.

3. **Project Portfolio**:
   - Build projects that demonstrate proficiency in both stacks, including CRUD operations, authentication systems, eCommerce platforms, and dashboards.
   - Deploy the applications and ensure they are production-ready.

## 📅 **Challenge Timeline**

**Start Date**: October 1, 2024  
**End Date**: April 18, 2025

The challenge is split into phases:
- **Foundation (Days 1-30)**: Basic understanding and setup of both stacks.
- **Intermediate Projects (Days 31-90)**: Building real-world projects with focus on backend and frontend interactions.
- **Advanced Mastery (Days 91-150)**: Developing more complex applications with full authentication and deployment.
- **Public Showcasing and Collaboration (Days 151-200)**: Open-source contributions and final projects.

## 🏆 **End Goal**

By the end of this challenge, I aim to:

1. **Master the MERN and JAM stacks**.
2. Build a **portfolio of real-world projects** that demonstrate my skills.
3. **Deploy** the applications and ensure they are optimized for production environments.
4. Gain a deep understanding of **backend and frontend development** in both stacks.
